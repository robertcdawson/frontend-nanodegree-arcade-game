## To become a warrior!

In this game, you play **Xena Jr**, a baby warrior princess. To win, you must traverse three rocky regions occupied by a ruthless band of insects known as Very Wicked Beetles (aka VW Beetles) and climb the Mountain of Majesty on the other side.

Yet, do not assume that one such crossing will suffice! Nay, this is no trifling test, little lass. To become a truly mature and mighty warrior, you must mount the Mountain *10 times* without losing all 5 of your divinely bestowed lives. Each time you reach your destination, you will be teleported back to the Plain of Pity where you began.

Do you accept this challenge? Will you become the mighty warrior princess you were always meant to be? Play now and find out!
